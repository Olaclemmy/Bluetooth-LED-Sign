If you use the Arduino 1.0 code, you will need to copy the ht1632C library into your libraries folder.
NOTE: the Arduino 0023 code runs slower, but has been shown to work on >2 displays.  The 1.0 code only 
works for 2 displays at the moment, as there is an issue with the library.

Android application:
Code is based on the included bluetooth chat example, customized and changed to work with the Bluetooth Sign.
